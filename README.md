I've just thrown together everything to be configured for vertcoin mining.

Instructions:
    git clone https://github.com/Charliecivil/stratum-mining/
    cd stratum-mining/externals
    git clone https://github.com/scr34m/vertcoin_scrypt
    mv vertcoin_scrypt vtc_scrypt
    
    
    DONE!! Config.py is already setup for vertcoin, aka scrypt-vtc is already entered into the algo.
