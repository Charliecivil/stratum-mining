I've just thrown together everything to be configured for vertcoin mining.

Instructions:<br>
    git clone https://github.com/Charliecivil/stratum-mining/<br>
    cd stratum-mining/externals<br>
    git clone https://github.com/scr34m/vertcoin_scrypt<br>
    mv vertcoin_scrypt vtc_scrypt<br>
    
    
DONE!! Config.py is already setup for vertcoin, aka scrypt-vtc is already entered into the algo.
